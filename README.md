# Metroville Urban Rail Expansion – Project Management Simulation
📌 Project Overview
a project management job simulation based on a Siemens Mobility urban rail expansion project. The project focuses on planning, tracking, and communicating progress for a large-scale public transportation initiative designed to improve connectivity, efficiency, and sustainability in a growing city.

The simulation emphasizes practical project management skills rather than deep rail engineering knowledge..

# 🎯 Project Objectives
Expand the urban rail network to underserved areas.
Reduce congestion and support population growth.
Promote environmental sustainability and reduced carbon emissions.
Maintain strong community engagement and stakeholder transparency.

# 🧑‍💼 Role & Responsibilities
Role: Project Manager
Key responsibilities included:
Developing meaningful Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Analyzing project updates from multiple teams.
Tracking construction, budget, electrification, and community feedback.
Creating a stakeholder-ready project dashboard.
Communicating risks, progress, and mitigation strategies clearly.

# 📊 Key Deliverables
1️⃣ KPI Development
Six KPIs were designed across three categories:
Technical Feasibility (construction & electrification progress)
Environmental Sustainability (emissions reduction, renewable energy use)
Community Acceptance (public feedback, accessibility improvements)

Each KPI includes:
Definition
Measurement method
Rationale

2️⃣ Project Tracking & Analysis
Project data was synthesized from:
Field supervisors (track installation progress)
Engineering leads (electrification & budget updates)
Community relations coordinators (public feedback)

Key areas tracked:
Track installation progress by region
Budget expenditure vs projections
Electrification milestones
Community concerns and positive feedback

3️⃣ Project Dashboard
A dashboard was designed to:
Visually communicate project status using charts and indicators
Highlight achievements, risks, and upcoming milestones
Balance quantitative data (metrics, percentages) with qualitative insights
Support quick decision-making for stakeholders
